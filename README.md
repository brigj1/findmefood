# Find Me Food!

This app helps users find interesting food trucks and push carts in San Francisco. It shows search fields that lets the user filter out "uninteresting" records as fetched from San Francisco, CA's [Mobile Food Facility Permit](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data) system.

You can fetch the code from Brigham Johnson's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/brigj1/findmefood).

## Futures:

Tests would be nice.
Lookups by enumerated types would be great for Status and Facility Type.
Massage the all-caps versions of Status values into mixed-case.
